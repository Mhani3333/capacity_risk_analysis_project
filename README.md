# Labor_Health_Analysis_Project
The primary goal of the project was to increase prevention and control the causes leading to medical issues in the centers. By doing so, we aimed to protect workers' health, improve productivity, and reduce the amount of time lost due to hospital visits.

## Project Overview
This project was undertaken for a Central Constructions Labor Zone consisting of 13 centers with a total of 6,084 workers unevenly distributed across the centers.
Each laborer stays in their respective center for at least 20 days, and many workers face health issues due to various reasons.
As a result, they frequently visit a nearby hospital with 13 departments (clinics).
## The collected data covered a period of 12 months (July 2023 to June 2024).

## Initial Challenges
Before this project, data collection was done manually with paper-based hospital records, making the information inaccurate and hard to manage.
Unskilled staff were responsible for recording the data, leading to errors and a lack of validation.

## Data Collection Transformation
The first step was to digitize the data collection process using a Google Form that standardized the input options.
This simple change improved data integrity and simplified validation. Data was automatically collected in a Google Sheet, making it easier to monitor, clean, and save.

# Key Insights and Findings
1. Surgery, Orthopedic, and Dermatology departments were the most visited.
2. Seasonal patterns were found, with higher visits in summer months.
3. Hospitalization rates were highest in the Surgery department.
